The aim of this guide is to provide the MakerDAO Community an overview of the governance processes involved in adding collateral types to the Maker Protocol.

## **2. Learning Objectives**

* Understand the collateral onboarding governance process from start to finish.
* Learn how to coordinate the governance processes and communications necessary to onboard collateral to the Maker Protocol.

## **3. Prerequisites**

* [Governance FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/governance-faq)
* [Introduction to the  Maker Protocol](https://docs.makerdao.com/)

## **5. MakerDAO Governance Roles**

* \*\*\*\*[**Governance Facilitator**](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP0/mip0.md#mip0c11-governance-facilitator-role)**:** The Governance Facilitator is tasked with ensuring the smooth operation of the governance process. This involves a wide range of activities, from general administration and signal-gathering to governance scheduling.
* \*\*\*\*[**MIP Editor**](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP0/mip0.md#mip0c10-mip-editor-role)**:** The MIP Editor enforces the administrative and editorial aspects of the overall MIPs process and framework.

## **6. Governance Process for Onboarding a Collateral Type to the Maker Protocol**

#### _An 11-step process must be followed to onboard a collateral type to the Maker Protocol:_

1. Read [MIP6](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP6/mip6.md) which defines the Collateral Onboarding Application. 
2. Complete the [Collateral Onboarding Application](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP6/MIP6c2-Collateral-Application-Template.md), and then [publish it to the MakerDAO Forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/c/collateral-onboarding/co/17) \(follow [this example](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/gusd-mip6-collateral-onboarding-application/3319)\), where it will remain open for discussion for two weeks.
3. Answer questions posed by the MakerDAO community. While not a requirement, your responses can help generate support or excitement for your proposed collateral type. You might also choose to organize a [collateral onboarding call](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/collateral-calls-calling-all-projects/3715) to further pitch the proposal and spur more community discussion.

4. After the two-week discussion period, the proposal is eligible for a Community Greenlight Poll \(defined in [MIP9](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP9/mip9.md)\).

* About [Collateral Onboarding Community Greenlight Polls](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP9/mip9.md)
*  Community Greenlight Polls are on-chain polls used to measure the governance community’s sentiment toward a proposed collateral type. Poll results are used to help inform the domain teams as they prioritize collateral types to onboard.  See [this example](https://mkrgov.science/poll/306)\).
* Community Greenlight Polls occur at a fixed time during each governance cycle, starting on the third Monday of the month and running for a period of two full weeks.

5. All proposed collateral types that go through the Community Greenlight Polls are added to the [Collateral Status Index](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/collateral-status-index/2231) and the [Collateral Onboarding Prioritization Framework spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IX9e2fyfz7djtDMKn5gMyGsyFxHoY75GncMbAjnSXrM/edit#gid=0) by the Governance Facilitator and/or Collateral Onboarding Domain Teams.

6. The domain teams use the Collateral Onboarding Prioritization Framework to help determine the order in which they write their domain collateral assessments and publish them to the Maker Forum. Here are three examples of Domain  Team Collateral Assessments, each for the BAL collateral type:

* [Risk Evaluation](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/bal-collateral-onboarding-risk-evaluation/4600/3) 
* [Oracles Assessment](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip10c3-sp12-proposal-balusd-oracle-collateral-onboarding-oracle-assessment/4638)
* [Smart Contracts Technical Assessment](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/bal-erc20-token-smart-contract-technical-assessment/4630)

7. On the Monday after domain teams have published their collateral assessments to the Forum, a Governance Poll begins. The poll measures the sentiment of MKR holders regarding the assessments. The cut-off day for queuing up a collateral onboarding Governance Poll is the Friday prior.  

* Example of a Collateral Onboarding Governance Poll:  [Add BAL as a Collateral Type - October 12, 2020](https://mkrgov.science/poll/330)

8. During the polling period, the collateral onboarding domain team work continues. For example, oracle solutions and smart contracts might be tested or completed.

9. If the Governance poll passes, an Executive Vote is scheduled to be held within 30 days, absent external factors. The time frame provides domain teams the flexibility to complete their work and testing to securely onboard the collateral type\(s\). If the Governance Poll doesn’t pass… a governance poll may be resubmitted in the future. In general,  governance polls for collateral onboarding may be resubmitted up to two more times before not being eligible for resubmission. However, it is recommended that the community first investigates why the governance poll failed the first time around before proceeding with the resubmission.  
  
10. The Executive Vote text is written by Governance Facilitator, and the Executive Spell is prepared by the Smart Contracts Domain team.

* [Example of Executive Vote Text ](https://github.com/makerdao/community/blob/master/governance/votes/Executive%20vote%20-%20June%2026%2C%202020.md)
* [Example of Executive Spell](https://github.com/makerdao/spells-mainnet/blob/master/archive/2020-09-28-DssSpell.sol)

11. If the Executive Vote passes, the collateral asset will be added to the Maker Protocol. If it doesn’t pass... the collateral type has officially been rejected from being added to the Maker Protocol. As mentioned in step 9, governance polls for collateral onboarding may be resubmitted up to two times before not being eligible for resubmission. If a resubmitted governance poll passes, it will proceed to an Executive Vote once again.

## **6. Get Involved**

The Collateral Onboarding Handbook aims to support the [Collateral Onboarding grants initiative](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/collateral-onboarding-grants/4252), which seeks to incentivize and reward contributors who coordinate around a directed objective: successfully onboard reliable and diverse collateral. With respect to governance, there is currently an opportunity to help out with Maker Governance. More specifically, such duties would include writing governance documentation, creating MIPs, and pursuing initiatives that improve the efficiency and integrity of the MakerDAO Governance process. For more information, see the [Wanted: Governance Help \(Forum Post\)](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/wanted-governance-help/3277).
