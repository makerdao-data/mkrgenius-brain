# How to Attract More Delegate MKR as a MakerDAO Recognized Delegate

Recognized Delegates in the Maker Protocol may wish to attract MKR holders to delegate to them in order to increase their voting power and potentially their financial rewards from the Maker Protocol. Ultimately, Recognized Delegates are responsible for making themselves an attractive option for MKR holders to delegate their MKR.

Below are some potential avenues that can be used to attract more delegated MKR from MKR holders. Please note this is not an exhaustive list.

* Engagement on the [MakerDAO forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/) can enable MKR holders to form an understanding of a Recognized Delegate's positions on various topics. Thorough communication of voting stances will potentially attract like-minded MKR holders to delegate their MKR.
* Participation in public calls, such as the Governance and Risk call, will likewise provide a platform for Recognized Delegates to share their views and opinions.
* Actively reaching out on social media in order to encourage MKR holders to delegate to them --- specially around more controversial issues that affect the Maker Protocol. These platforms may be especially fruitful for this approach:
    * [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com), in particular these communities:
      * [r/makerdao](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/)
      * [r/ethfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/)
      * [r/ethtrader](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/)
      * [r/cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/)
    * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)
* Some large token holders have delegate programs that Recognized Delegates can approach to try to source more voting power. Alternatively, delegates may wish to directly approach known holders of large amounts of MKR to encourage them to delegate.
* Consider campaigning on issues with less representation among other delegates. Uniqueness may encourage MKR holders to delegate their MKR.
* Consider underrepresented groups or geographical regions and appeal to users located within those groups.
