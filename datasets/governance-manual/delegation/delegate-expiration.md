# Delegate Expiration

MakerDAO's vote delegation system is based on VoteDelegate smart contracts, which can be generated by anyone through the Governance Portal by sending a transaction to the VoteDelegateFactory contract on Ethereum mainnet. VoteDelegate contracts expire annually by design, which requires both delegates and their delegators to migrate periodically.

## Expiration by design

VoteDelegate contracts expire by design, as a means to protect the Maker protocol against stale MKR tokens participating in Maker governance. The design protects the Maker protocol against the following scenarios, for example:

* A delegate with significant voting power turning malicious and with 'passive' MKR being delegated to them
* A large delegator loses access to their wallet and now their MKR tokens are 'stuck' in a delegate contract without a way to undelegate, which can lead to unforeseen consequences in case of a delegate turning malicious

VoteDelegate contracts expire exactly 365 days after its creation. The exact expiry date and time can be found on a delegate's profile page on the Governance Portal. This applies to both Recognized Delegates and Shadow Delegates.

## Migration for delegates
Recognized Delegates that own a VoteDelegate contract that's nearing expiration will be shown a prominent banner on the Governance Portal, prompting the delegate to migrate. The banner will redirect them to [the migration page for delegates](https://vote.makerdao.com/migration/delegate). 
The delegate will be required to prepare a new address for creating the renewed delegate contract, since an address can only own one delegate contract (expired or not). The migration steps are as follows:

* Step 1. Undelegate any of their own MKR holdings from their delegate contract
* Step 2. Prepare a different Ethereum address that they own, that they will use to generate a new delegate contract.
* Step 3. Submit this address through the Governance Portal UI to have it verified and linked to their prior delegate contract. This process might require the delegate to wait for a few hours since it involves some manual steps. NOTE: For users of the Gnosis Safe multisig wallet, the process will involve posting an on-chain transaction which needs to be manually shared with the MakerDAO DUX team through Discord.
* Step 4. Connect this new Ethereum address to the Governance Portal, and click the banner to continue the migration process. You'll be asked to navigate to the account page and generate a new delegate contract. Once created, the migration is essentially completed.
* Step 5. Delegate any of their own MKR holdings to the new delegate contract.
* Step 6. Encourage their delegators to migrate their delegated MKR.
Once a delegate successfully finished their migration, their old and new addresses are linked and the Governance Portal UI will display their prior delegate profile in aggregation. Their prior profile markdown, performance metrics, voting history and commenting history will be visible on their new delegate contract profile page. A successful migration also triggers migration prompts for their delegators who still have MKR delegated to the old delegate contract.

The links between the old and new delegate contract owner addressess can be found in a [mapping file](https://github.com/makerdao/governance-portal-v2/blob/master/modules/migration/delegateAddressLinks.ts) on the GitHub repository. This mapping file is used by the Governance Portal to show the metadata of Recognized Delegates on all their associated old and new delegate contracts. The file is also used by various other teams (eg. DIN). This file can be considered the source of truth for determining which EOAs (user-owned addressess) are associated with a Recognized Delegate. The file is open-source and can be viewed by anyone.

## Migration for delegators

Delegators that have delegated MKR to a delegate contract which has been migrated OR expired will be shown a prominent banner on the Governance Portal, prompting the delegator to migrate. On [the migration page for delegators](https://vote.makerdao.com/migration/delegator) all expired and about-to-expire delegate contracts are shown, including the total MKR amount delegated by the user. It also displays the renewed delegate contracts.

Through the UI the delegators are guided through the process of undelegating from the old contracts, and delegating to the new contracts. Note: This also involved creating token approval transactions in case a user is delegating/undelegating from a VoteDelegate contract the first time.

## Upcoming changes to vote delegation

The current design of VoteDelegate expiration succeeds in protecting the protocol against stale MKR tokens, but also adds a lot of recurring friction to both delegates and delegatorsâ€”ultimately providing a negative incentive to participate in Maker vote delegation. Improvement points to the VoteDelegateFactory contract have been defined and will likely be implemented by the end of 2022.
