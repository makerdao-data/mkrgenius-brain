# Off-Chain Governance

Off-chain governance can be exercised in multiple ways and with different objectives: as the free exchange of ideas to improve the protocol; as a way of gathering feedback to support and inform prospective on-chain governance; or as a way to approve or reject formal processes. In what follows the available means to conduct off-chain governance are described in increasing order of formality.

## Discussion and Debate

[Discussion](https://forum.makerdao.com/tags/c/governance/5/discussion) is the most informal, most free-form way of conducting off-chain governance. While discussion is not specific to MakerDAO, its power to effect change should not be underestimated. Discussions can be brought forth by anyone.

## Informal Polls

[Informal Polls](https://forum.makerdao.com/tags/c/governance/5/informal-poll) make use of the forum's support for poll creation. Informal Polls provide a set of options for the community to vote on. Although more structured than discussions, they cannot effect protocol changes nor trigger processes immediately; they are commonly used to measure community sentiment about issues affecting the MakerDAO ecosystem. Informal Polls can be created by anyone and there are no guidelines on the general use of Informal Polls other than courtesy and common sense.

## Signal Requests

Signal Requests are the most immediately powerful means of effecting change off-chain. Signal Requests are a type of poll whose specific parameters and necessity are established by processes that have been ratified within the MIPs Framework. The nature of the effects of Signal Requests can vary greatly in accordance to the MIP-ratified process that requires or allows Signal Requests.

_Historic note: Before the passing of [MIP4c2-SP27](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP4c2SP27), Signal Requests could be initiated by anyone and needed not be triggered nor required by a ratified MIP process._
