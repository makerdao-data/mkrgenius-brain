# Proposal Bounties

MakerDAO rewards classes of governance action that result in measurable changes to the way the Maker Protocol or MakerDAO operates.

This page describes how this incentivization mechanism operates.

GovAlpha strongly recommends that you confirm with us before working on a proposal to ensure that it is eligible for bounty payouts.

### The Bounty Pool

A pool of 6,000 DAI per month is allocated for distribution amongst the authors of successful MakerDAO governance proposals.

This pool comes out of the GovAlpha Core Unit's budget. 

### Eligible Proposal Types

Proposals eligible for rewards are:
* Successful MIP proposals
* Successful MIP Subproposals
* Successful Signal Requests

A proposal is considered successful if its on-chain vote meets the success criteria defined in the accompanying on-chain poll text.

### Rewards

The **maximum** reward for each type of successful proposal is denoted below.

* MIP - 2,000 DAI
* Subproposal - 1,000 DAI
* Signal - 500 DAI

The 6,000 DAI reward pool is split between eligible proposals in a given month and may be significantly less depending on the volume of proposals submitted in a given month.

The reward pool for a given month is split between proposals according to the following weights.
* MIP = 1
* Subproposal = 1/2
* Signal = 1/4

### Payout Process

Rewards are distributed at the start of each month, covering proposals that concluded in the previous month.

Payouts are consolidated into a CSV file and distributed by GovAlpha from the GovAlpha multi-sig wallet.

GovAlpha produces a short report each month communicating the initiatives and the users rewarded.
