# Harbor Trade Credit
Senior-secured loans against trade payables/invoices. Typically with 30-120 day maturities. 

Harbor Trade Credit operates within the space of Supply Chain Finance. Supply Chain Finance is similar to factoring, another working capital solution in trade finance. 

Unlike factoring, where a supplier sells its receivables at a discount to a third party (a factor) for early payment, supply chain finance is a financing solution initiated by the buyer where the buyer agrees to pay an invoice early for a discount. 

In HTC’s case, it will pay the seller/supplier early (on behalf of the buyer) and issue a short-term loan to the buyer secured against that buyer’s trade payable/invoice.
