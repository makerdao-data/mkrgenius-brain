# Huntingdon Valley Bank

A wide variety of senior-secured loans originated by the community bank in the normal course of business. Typically 6 - 60 month maturities. Loan types include:
- **Stabilized CRE Loans**: mortgages against retail, industrial, hospitality, and office assets which are tenanted and cash-flowing. 
- **Construction CRE Loans**: mortgages for the construction of commercial buildings.
- **Lender Finance**: revolving credit facilities issued to lenders who originate the prior two asset types. 
- **Business Loans**: loans to companies, secured against equipment or real estate. 
- **Capital Call Lines**: loans to private equity firms for working capital between capital calls on limited partners of the fund. 
- **Consumer Loans**: unsecured loans to individuals. 
- **Residential RE Loans**: mortgages for individuals secured against homes. 

The HVB vault is structured as a participation facility in which DAI is minted directly against end assets. The yield on the assets that HVB originates is passed through directly to MakerDAO. 

This structure contrasts to one where Maker would receive yield (fixed or floating) from a revolving credit facility that an originator would tap to fund end assets. So, Maker owns the end assets directly. 

If assets are eligible for Maker’s participation, then half the loan will be sold to Maker’s trust.
