### Core Values

* **Decentralization maximalist**
My votes will favor proposals that increase DAO participation by retail users, improve transparency of info between Core Units & retail users, and eliminate any unnecessarily centralized chokepoints that may exist within the DAO.

* **Trust minimalist**
My votes will favor proposals that reduce, not increase, the amount of trust that retail DAI users need to have in Maker Core Units and collateral agents.

* **Adversarial thinker**
My votes will favor proposals for economic & technical solutions that are immune to manipulation, exploit and/or attack by network participants, state actors, or any other party that may wish to disrupt the continuity of DAI.

### Delegate Statement

I was first introduced to MakerDAO in early 2019 when I discovered the burgeoning world of DeFi. I was thrilled to learn about the innovation of a decentralized stablecoin managed by a DAO. I worked with the Community team to develop explainer video content and participated in MKR governance throughout that year. I introduced many new DeFi users to the idea of a decentralized stablecoin through my video explainers.

[ ***VIDEO: Here's a video on DAI governance that I created 3 years ago that some of you may find entertaining!***](https://vimeo.com/716043636/8bb139f044)

In 2020, I came to the realization that much of DeFi wasn't nearly as decentralized as it was advertising itself. At that point, I began to focus more on educating DeFi users about the importance of decentralization & trustlessness to our future economic freedom.

Since that time, I've watched MakerDAO mature into a truly unique organization, redefining the term "DAO" in the process.

**I believe that MakerDAO is now one of the most important initiatives - not just in DeFi - but in the entire world of global finance today.**

I want to help shape the next era for MakerDAO. Now more than ever, MakerDAO needs diversity in its governance input. I will provide that.

While I tend to be a "decentralization maximalist", I also recognize that the problems that MakerDAO is trying to solve are far from binary in nature. Many of them require complex and thoughtful solutions that require trade-offs in both decentralization and trustlessness.

I am not here to be an extremist or shut down conversations that aren't completely aligned with my point of view. I'm not here to try to revert MakerDAO back to 2019. Rather, I am here to provide a strong (and sometimes contrarian) voice of support for the principles in which I believe, in the context of thoughtful and meaningful conversations.

**I'm here to act as a voice for MKR holders who understand that trade-offs have to happen in the course of MakerDAO governance, but only when they are fruitful, secure and necessary.**

I'm not coming into this as someone who has a firm position on every issue that the DAO is currently facing. I am coming into this as someone with a solid & proven set of principles that I will apply to Maker governance issues as they arise.

I will participate in governance discussions and clearly explain my votes to you. I do not currently own any MKR. My goal and reason for being here is to help MakerDAO get to a place where I would feel *comfortable* owning MKR.

Thank you for trusting me to vote on your behalf.

### Conflicts of Interest

I have no conflicts of interest. I will disclose any that may arise in the future.

### Delegates Code of Conduct

I have read the Code of Conduct and make best efforts to adhere to it.

### Waiver of Liability

By delegating to Chris Blec, you acknowledge and agree that Chris Blec will participate in MakerDAO governance on a best-effort basis and will not be liable for any form of damages related to participation in the Maker Protocol, or MakerDAO.
